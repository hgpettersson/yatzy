# yatzy
I created a Yatzy game to learn python. This is the documentation of the game which I originally created before coding it to decide how to build it.

First version of the game has only 1 player.


Improvements that can be made:
- Add full house category (I forgot it)
- Add input validation
  - If giving invalid dice number, we get a list out-of-range error.
- Add x number of players (only single player now)
- Save/resume the game mid-game
- Better UX of choosing two pairs
